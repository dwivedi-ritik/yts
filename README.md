### Yts

yts clone is react web app where you can browse see summary and even download movies. yts clone provide you clean bright interface for browsing movies. This web app uses yts.mx APIs.

yts does not have ads its provide clean user friendly UI.

### Backend

Unfortunately yts does not provide CORS in their APIs so i have to make a proxy server. You can do post request to the server with parameter `query_term` which return the matched movies in json format.

```shell
$ npm run start
```

### Dev

```shell
$ npm run start
